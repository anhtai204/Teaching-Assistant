    Central state passed between every node in the graph.

    Attributes:
        messages: Chat history (system + user + assistant + tool messages).
                  Uses the `add_messages` reducer so each node can *append*
                  rather than replace.
        user_id:  Identifies the user for memory look-ups.
        session_id: Groups turns within one conversation session.
        sources:  Citation sources collected during tool execution.
        memory_block: Formatted long-term memory string injected into system prompt.
        summary_block: Running session summary injected into system prompt.
        route: Routing decision from router agent ('retrieval' | 'direct').
        route_reason: Human-readable reason for route decision.
        retrieved_chunks: Structured chunks returned by retrieval agent.
        final_answer: Final answer text prepared by tutor/direct branch.
